# SignalRoute AI -- Cellular Network-Aware Routing System

An ML-powered navigation platform that recommends routes based on **predicted cellular signal quality** alongside ETA and distance. Traditional routing engines (Google Maps, Waze) optimize purely for time -- SignalRoute adds network awareness to prevent dropped calls, lost connectivity, and dead zone interruptions.

**Problems solved:**
- Calls dropping mid-route through dead zones
- Ride-hailing apps disconnecting in weak coverage areas
- Fleet tracking going offline on certain highways
- Emergency SOS failing to send in tunnels or underpasses
- Navigation updates stopping in areas with no signal
- Video/music buffering on routes through low-density zones

## How It Works

```
User enters source + destination
         |
   TomTom Routing API generates up to 7 road-snapped alternatives
         |
   Each route path sampled at 500m intervals
         |
   ResidualSignalNet (PyTorch) predicts signal strength + drop probability per point
         |
   Physics validation via COST-231 Hata + Ericsson 9999 propagation ensemble
         |
   Routes scored: weighted_score = preference * signal_norm + (1-preference) * eta_norm
         |
   Dead zone detection identifies contiguous weak segments per carrier
         |
   RL (Thompson Sampling) personalizes weights per user over time
         |
   Ranked results displayed on Mapbox GL JS map with signal heatmap overlay
```

## Demo

**Bangalore Demo Route: MG Road to Electronic City**

| Route | ETA | Signal | Behavior |
|-------|-----|--------|----------|
| Fastest Route | 28 min | Medium (48) | Direct via Hosur Road -- enters weak signal zone |
| Balanced Route | 36 min | Medium (50) | Via HSR Layout -- avoids worst dead zones |
| Best Signal Route | 47 min | Medium (45) | Detours through Koramangala, Jayanagar -- strong coverage |

The user adjusts a preference slider (0 = pure speed, 100 = pure signal) and the ranking updates in real-time.

## Features

### Core Navigation
- **Multi-route comparison** -- Up to 7 TomTom road-snapped alternatives with ETA/distance/signal scores
- **Two-phase route loading** -- Fast routes appear in 1-2s (heuristic scores), full ML scoring follows in 15-60s
- **Preference slider** -- Dynamic weight adjustment between speed and connectivity (0-100)
- **Carrier filter** -- Route scoring per telecom provider (Jio, Airtel, Vi, BSNL) or multi-SIM mode
- **Signal heatmap** -- Color-coded zone overlay on the map (signal strength, traffic congestion)
- **Dead zone alerts** -- Toast notifications when approaching weak signal areas across all carriers
- **Live rerouting** -- Periodic re-evaluation during navigation with automatic reroute if conditions change
- **Real GPS tracking** -- Live position tracking via browser geolocation API with route progress estimation

### Signal Intelligence
- **Multi-SIM scoring** -- Scores every route across all carriers independently, picks best per segment, returns per-carrier breakdown and combined best-of-all score
- **Signal stability metrics** -- Continuity score (signal standard deviation), longest stable window (consecutive strong segments), and combined stability score
- **Hard ETA constraints** -- Configurable max ETA ratio (default 1.5x fastest). Routes exceeding the cap are marked rejected with a "Too Slow" badge
- **Predictive bad zone warnings** -- Detects upcoming dead zones with estimated time-to-zone, zone duration, and minimum signal. Displayed in sidebar with edge zone names (tunnels, underpasses)
- **Offline bundle** -- Full route data, bad zones, segment signals, and heatmap snapshot saved for offline access
- **Call-drop avoidance** -- Counts segments with drop probability > 0.5 and compares recommended route against worst alternative

### ML / AI
- **Signal prediction model** -- ResidualSignalNet (PyTorch, 560K params) with 22-feature input, multi-task output (signal strength, drop probability, handoff risk)
- **Physics validation** -- COST-231 Hata + Ericsson 9999 propagation ensemble cross-checks ML predictions
- **MC Dropout uncertainty** -- 8 forward passes estimate prediction confidence per segment
- **Thompson Sampling RL** -- Per-user contextual bandit learns signal vs speed preference over time. Converges in 3-5 trips
- **Smart intent resolution** -- 10 intents (meeting, call, navigation, streaming, etc.) mapped to preference values with fuzzy matching
- **Weather-aware scoring** -- OpenWeather API provides real-time weather factor that degrades signal predictions in rain/storms

### Map and UX
- **Mapbox GL JS** -- WebGL-accelerated map with layered route rendering (glow + casing + main line), smooth camera transitions, pitch/bearing 3D support
- **Real cell tower overlay** -- 601 towers from OpenCelliD rendered at actual coordinates, color-coded by operator
- **Draggable A/B pins** -- Drag source/destination markers to reroute interactively
- **Mapbox Search Box** -- Autocomplete with Bangalore viewbox bias for source/destination
- **Route detail view** -- Sidebar toggles between route list and selected route detail with signal bars, ETA, distance, and start/stop navigation
- **Conversational route finder** -- Step-by-step chatbot for route setup (source, destination, network priority, road quality, ISP)
- **Browser GPS** -- "Use my location" with reverse geocoding to populate source field
- **Network auto-detect** -- Detects carrier via Navigator.connection API + backend IP lookup
- **Onboarding tour** -- 5-step guided tour for new users
- **JWT authentication** -- Login/register with in-memory demo store or MongoDB-backed persistence

## Scoring Engine

### Route Ranking Formula

```
final_score = weight * (signal_score / 100) + (1 - weight) * eta_score + stability_bonus
stability_bonus = (stability_score / 100) * 0.1 * weight
```

| Variable | Range | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `weight` | 0.0 - 1.0 | User preference (slider: 0 = speed, 1 = signal) |
| `signal_score` | 0 - 100 | Average predicted signal strength along route |
| `eta_score` | 0.0 - 1.0 | Normalized ETA (1 = fastest candidate, 0 = slowest) |
| `stability_score` | 0 - 100 | Combined continuity + longest-stable-fraction metric |
| `stability_bonus` | 0 - 0.1 | Up to 10% boost for stable signal routes (scales with weight) |

### RL Personalization (Thompson Sampling)

Each user has a Beta(alpha, beta) distribution learned over time:

```
rl_sample ~ Beta(alpha, beta)
effective_weight = 0.6 * user_weight + 0.4 * rl_sample
```

- User picks signal-heavy route and is satisfied -> alpha += 1
- User picks speed route and is satisfied -> beta += 1
- Over time, the system learns each user's true preference

### Signal Prediction

The ML model (ResidualSignalNet) predicts signal quality at each point:

**Input features (22 dims):** latitude, longitude, tower distance, tower signal dBm, terrain type (7 one-hot), hour (sin/cos), density, building height, operator, tower range, frequency, tx power, tower height, path loss, weather factor

**Output (3 heads):** signal_strength (0-100), drop_probability (0-1), handoff_risk (0-1)

## Real-Time Data Sources

### TomTom Routing API

Used for road-snapped multi-route generation with live traffic.

**Fields extracted per route:**

| Field | Source | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `eta` | `summary.travelTimeInSeconds` | Travel time in minutes (includes traffic) |
| `traffic_delay` | `summary.trafficDelayInSeconds` | Extra delay vs free-flow in minutes |
| `geometry` | `legs[].points[].latitude/longitude` | Road-snapped path (430-824 points per route) |
| `distance_km` | Computed from geometry | Haversine sum of consecutive points |

**Additional fields available (not yet extracted):**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `summary.lengthInMeters` | Exact road distance in meters |
| `summary.departureTime` | Estimated departure time (ISO 8601) |
| `summary.arrivalTime` | Estimated arrival time (ISO 8601) |
| `summary.noTrafficTravelTimeInSeconds` | ETA with zero traffic (needs `computeTravelTimeFor=all`) |
| `summary.historicTrafficTravelTimeInSeconds` | Historic average ETA |
| `summary.liveTrafficIncidentsTravelTimeInSeconds` | Live incident-adjusted ETA |
| Traffic sections: `simpleCategory` | Per-segment incident type: JAM, ROAD_WORK, ROAD_CLOSURE |
| Traffic sections: `effectiveSpeedInKmh` | Speed through incident zone |
| Traffic sections: `delayInSeconds` | Delay caused by each incident |
| Traffic sections: `magnitudeOfDelay` | Severity: 0=unknown, 1=minor, 2=moderate, 3=major, 4=closure |

### OpenCelliD API

Used for real-time cell tower lookup along each route path. Queried via `cell/getInArea` with a bounding box around sampled route points.

**Raw fields returned per tower:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `lat`, `lon` | float | Tower coordinates |
| `mcc` | int | Mobile Country Code (404 or 405 for India) |
| `mnc` | int | Mobile Network Code (identifies carrier) |
| `lac` | int | Location Area Code |
| `cellid` | int | Unique cell tower ID |
| `radio` | string | Technology: GSM, UMTS, LTE, NR, NBIOT |
| `averageSignalStrength` | int (dBm) | Crowd-sourced avg signal (e.g. -70 to -105 dBm; 0 = no data) |
| `range` | int (meters) | Estimated coverage radius |
| `samples` | int | Number of crowd-sourced measurements (data quality) |
| `changeable` | bool | `true` = position from measurements; `false` = operator-certified |
| `tac` | int | Tracking Area Code (LTE/NR only) |
| `rnc` | int | Radio Network Controller (UMTS only) |

**Derived fields computed in `model/opencellid.py`:**
